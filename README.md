## About Lifestyle
Lifestyle is a interactive mobile application integrating a digital diary, calendar planner and goal journal.

## Special Features
### Map Feature
This feature is incorporated in the diary section, allowing users to record the location of an event or where the diary entry is written. The program detects the user's current position and displays the location on the map with a pin marker. Users can also manually select a location by placing a pin on their desired point. When selected, location information is displayed in a small pop-up window.

### Calendar
The calendar is created using the ***ionic2-calendar*** library. Users can choose to view the calendar either monthly, weekly or daily. It allows users to add reminders or events in the calendar.

### Goal Chart
The goal journal includes a chart feature that tracks and visually illustrates the percentage of completed and uncompleted goals.
